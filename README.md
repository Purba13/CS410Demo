# First-time Setup
Pre-requisites:
1. Python 3.X
2. npm

To initialize and obtain all required package dependencies:

- Backend

Run the following commands:

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
```

- Frontend

```
cd www
npm install

```

# Hosting

To run a local server:

1. Start the backend Flask server.
```
pipenv run python app.py
```

2. Start the frontend Angular server in a separate window.
```
cd www
ng serve
```

3. Open a browser and the server will be running on http://localhost:4200/.


# Development

Pre-requisite:
To ensure that the same libraries are available on the server as well as your local development environment, use the Pipfile included to ensure all packages are available. Run `pipenv shell` to obtain an environment that mimicks the server.

1. Create your classifier that implements the `IClassifier` interface for predict, train and pre_process. See *IClassifier.py* for documentation, and other sample files included in the *classifiers* folder.
2. Copy your classifier into the *classifiers* folder.
3. Add a *MyClassifier.yapsy-plugin* file to describe your classifier.
3. When you start Spotlight, the classifier will automatically be loaded for testing and training.
4. If you would like to train your model outside your application, but test the model within the application, you may create a pickle file containing the model and upload it directly.
